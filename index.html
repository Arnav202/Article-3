<p>Logic gates are used in microcontrollers, microprocessors, and electronic and electrical projects <br>
circuits, and embedded system applications.
 The basic logic gates are categorized into seven types as<br> 
<ol><li><mark>AND</mark>,</li> <li><mark>OR,</mark></li> <li><mark>XOR,</mark></li> <li><mark>NAND,</mark></li> <li><mark>NOR,</mark></li> <li><mark>XNOR,</mark></li> <li><mark>NOT.</mark></li></ol> 
These are the important digital logic switch, mainly based on the Boolean function.
</p>
<p>Logic gates can be built using a relay "mechanical switch" or transistors.<br> Since relays are very slow I decided to use transistors instead of relays.<br></p>

<h3>Explanation-</h3> 
You must have used calculators, computers, or some other electronic devices<br> 
and you must have thought that <mark>how they store information </mark>so well<br> 
e.g- <mark>like calculator latching "mathematical" values in its display, The storing component here<br>   
is a transistor</mark>. A transistor used in a computer chip is a very tiny small transistor<br> 
<mark>"7-10 nanometers in size"</mark> The transistor can be either <mark>ON or OFF,</mark> it can't be<br>  
in the middle stage which is called the <mark>"linear region of a transistor".</mark> So to represent<br> 
the transistor is <mark>ON or OFF we use "ones (1's) and zeros (0's)", and the binary systems are <br> 
filled with such "ones (1) and zeros (0)" which represent the state of the transistor.</mark> Binary<br>  
systems are used to process certain tasks like storing some information, or for data transmission.<br>

Now, more about logic gates working<br> 
 <br> 
Suppose there is a battery, and <mark>two switches in series that connects to a bulb</mark> (figure4.1)<br>  
And let's name them <mark>A and B </mark>(figure4.2) if <mark>switch A is "closed" </mark>(turning on a switch)<br>  
And if <mark>B is open</mark> (fig4.3) then the output <mark>bulb will be off</mark> since no current flows through <br> 
the bulb now, if <mark>I close switch B </mark>(fig4.4) <mark>the bulb will turn ON </mark>because the current flows<br> 
through it. And that's how an AND gate works, </p><br>
